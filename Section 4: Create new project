# 17. Add Dockerfile
## use [3.7-alpine] image

## set [python unbuffered] environment variable
- [ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1]
- recommended when running Python in containers to not allow Python to buffer the outputs
- just prints them directly
- avoids complications running Docker application

## store dependencies in requirements.txt list
- [COPY ./requirements.txt /requirements.txt] copy file from our folder (containing Dockerfile) to image
- [RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt] installs the depencies found in requirements.txt into image

## make directory in image to store application source code
- [RUN mkdir /app]
- [WORKDIR /app]
- [COPY ./app /app]

## create a user that will run our application using Docker
- [RUN adduser -D user] D is to create a user used for running applications only
- [USER user] switches Docker to the user we have just created
- reason to do this is for security purposes
- if you don't do this, then the image will run our application using the root account
-- not recommended because if somebody compromises our application, they can have root access to the whole image and do malicious things
- a separate account just for our application limits the scope an attacker would have within our Docker container

## save

## first line of requirements.txt, install Django
- https://pypi.org/ then search "django" 
- LESSON's latest version is [Django 2.1.3]
-- so, syntax is [Django>=2.1.3,<2.2.0]

## then Django REST Framework
- Python Package Index search "djangorestframework" WITH NO SPACES
- LESSON's latest version is [djangorestframework 3.9.0]

## build the Docker image
- [docker build .]
